**If i had to relive my life again i would do the same mistakes twice ; only faster** 

Ask any startupper and (s)he will tell you failing was not the hardest part ; getting over it was. I am sometimes shit scared to fall into the similar conundrum yet i find myself being attracted to it all over again. After sometime you don't necessarily think of it as a good or bad omen ; it starts to become a usual motion when you are trying to start a startup or scaling it to new heights. 

Failing is a ... **Process** Give it some room :

Failure much like anything else is a process or a phenomenon.I want to write a blog post and a random process inside my head tries to be the bad (or good) guy and asks what if people don't read it , i want to write a new app and here we go yet again What if people don't use it. **What if** is a strong word to ask ; yet you take certain things for granted not that its not important to ask it very much is. And failure is very similar , its part of a process or sometimes the whole process. Whats the difference between a **Mistake** and a **Failure**.? The difference is apparent yet so many people use them interchangeably.

Failing has its advantages :
When you or your team fail you end up back from the dead when you begin again. The process is liberating , sometimes failing will help you look up at what you are doing and observe it with an angle that you had never seen before. What you thought would work doesn't work **yet** but that doesn't mean its impossible. Most of the times people fail , teams fail but where they really really fail is not getting over it. That is what is stopping me or you or anyone , we give excuses and there are ones who give zero flying fucks and get shit done. Its the ability of a good team to rise over , fall back again several times that makes it better than one that runs at the first sight of trouble 

As a wise man once said "A wise man learns from the mistakes of others and a fool from his own" ; dear wise man what am i if i do new mistakes.? ;)
