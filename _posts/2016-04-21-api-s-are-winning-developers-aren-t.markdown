title: API's are winning developers aren't

**API's** are cool , they are so useful ; they are an enablers in so many ways. API's are more often than not used as a tool to get Developers to extend the core platform in many ways ; but we have received a smack in the back for using a lot of stuff to do *cool* stuff. Google , Facebook , Yahoo you name it and chances are they have shut down a popular API all of the times. **Parse** was something that sent shock waves that echoed everywhere ;  something that showed the awe of the good and bad things about these developer focused products.  

**API is not the new Growth Hacking :**
I hate to be the one breaking this to you but in case you are counting on getting a developer interested to improve your fortune by making an (Unofficial) Android or iOS app that works better than yours chances its not going to happen. Of course you are going to take this with a pinch of salt ; the truth is it *may* work. If i was someone who wanted to do something cool in my spare time chances are i will be doing it for a platform that i like. I don't want to do it for Twitter because its *API Limiting Sucks* but same isn't the case with Digital Ocean for instance their API is written with developer happiness in mind and i love their platform ditto for Slack , PH and others that i love to use. 

**Attracting Developers is not your cup of tea :** 
When i want to write something using with your API i want it to be written it for other developers to make it useful and as easy to use as possible.
