Everything moves on  every opportunity ,  friends , mentors , moments and most of them can’t be gotten back. Sometimes we are scared to move on , i know as i was ; heck i did not intend to write this whole piece here but did so anyway. Doing the same mistakes twice are certainly a luxury only a few people can afford or so i have been told the thing is i did them over and over again several times. When you are nearly completing 1/5th of your supposed time period not everything feels right , the clock is ticking it always does never knowing why.? Same is the case with me , i took too long to realize that i was thrown in with a lot of others with no purpose , with no ambition and certainly with no one to tell me anything about the same. But then that is not entirely true as time goes on you start to realize stuff that seemed like the most weird puzzles to you , some might even get tired of puzzles.

**Wait till someone  tells you that you can’t change your destiny ** :

I was shit scared when i heard about it , i dreaded a lot. But then common sense prevails over everything else the same was the case with me. If destiny was fixed why the heck do we all have to live it all because its all gonna happen. Most of the world is in turmoil because of the difference in our ideologies , not that i blame them for thinking that way but the fault is of the times we are living in. If you asked me as to how long did i want to live when i was 5 i would tell you about a 1000 years , the number has if anything only gone down by twenty folds by now. I guess it will continue to do the same till the graph flattens out and the expectations and reality meet somewhere down the line.

 

**Figuring stuff out is not really the best way out ** : 

I remember those games that used to come in comics and magazines that i used to read when i was in 2nd grade. There would be some characters and i was expected to keep my hand at them and take them out of the place. It seemed easy at first , at one point i left doing it completely little did i know that it was one of the best life lessons that lied before me. I was expected to follow what *they* said or so everyone told me ; wait till you get mature quickly.  No one will come before you with a bazooka to blast you off for not following them. Heck the guys who supposedly tell you where to go are giving you an easy answer one that you will not find satisfaction with yet most of tend to swallow it the same because trust. Sometimes we tend to ignore our natural indicators , you see they tend to be right about most of the things every goddamn time. When you hit a roadblock know that it was there not to prevent you from going in but for others with lesser virtues. I would love to be wrong , i have not experienced everything yet i am still learning on. I hope when i come back to this nearly a decade later maybe i will laugh it all off or will shrug off over the fact that i over thought it either ways it will imply that i am growing.
